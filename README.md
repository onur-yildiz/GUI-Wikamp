This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.5.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes Node.jsÂ® and an npm package manager.

Node.js
Angular requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x.

To check your version, run node -v in a terminal/console window.

To get Node.js, go to __[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)__ (Current version is recommended).

__npm package manager__
Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as npm packages. To download and install npm packages, you must have an npm package manager.

This Quick Start uses the npm client command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default.

To check that you have the npm client installed, run npm -v in a terminal/console window.

### Step 1: Install the Angular CLI
You use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.

Install the Angular CLI globally.

To install the CLI using npm, open a terminal/console window and enter the following command:

__npm install -g @angular/cli__


### Step 2: Install dependencies
To install the dependencies, open a terminal/console window in the project folder and enter the following command:

__npm i__



### Step 3: Development server

Run `ng serve` from terminal/console window in the project folder for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
